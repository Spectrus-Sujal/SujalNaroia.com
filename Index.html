            <p id="GameDescription">​Skeleton Dave is a game that I had been planning to make with my friends for over half a year. It had initially started off as an idea for a game jam, but we could not make the game as the time of 2 weeks was too little and everyone was busy with their classes. 

                ​
                
                After high school ended, we all decided to get back to work on the game and try to make something that we can brag about to everyone. On Wednesday July 14 we had a meeting which we used to delegate work to everyone. I had been given the task to code the AI for the game. Currently I have a very basic enemy ready which will guard a point until the player approached it. I have decided to rework my idea as it was not very effective and left much to be desired. Now I am trying to make an even better AI script which will represent the growth that I have achieved as a coder. 
                
                ​
                
                I want to make an AI that is challenging to the players, but is a challenge that makes you want to improve and do better against it the next time you fight. I will try to make the final boss of Skeleton Dave be something that is memorable to everyone who plays the game.
